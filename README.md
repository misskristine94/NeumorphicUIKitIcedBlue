# NeumorphicUIKitIcedBlue
Iced blue neumorphic UI kit for your Power Apps!

![icedblue](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/86930618/178976443-c8b52136-246b-492c-96d8-2ceb0c6c041d.gif)


Welcome to the new world of design in Power Apps! This toolkit has been curated using a fusion of out-of-the-box controls and code to extend the existing control set and take your Power Apps UI to the next level!

The toolkit has a number of components which have various properties that you can customise without going into the code itself. If you do however wish to make any adjustments etc., you have the ability to edit the code directly within the application from the Components pane. Please note that this kit is packaged as a canvas app in a .zip file, so you'll need to import it as a Canvas App.

The toolkit comprises of two screens each â€“ these screens allow you to pick the themes of all your controls without having to change them individually. The first screen has lineal gradients, and the second screen allows you to pick and mix. The values of those are kept in the AppOnStart collections including the Default theme which is stored in a variable.

Please see below a breakdown of the toolkit - I hope you enjoy it and I'd love to hear your feedback! ðŸ˜Š

 This control is fully scalable so you can extend them both ways. It has the following properties:
-	IconName â€“ to make life easier and save you from having to find SVG code online, I have embedded 24most common icons into the button. So all you need to do in this property is type one of the following names of supported icons:
calendar,
bag,  
basket,
clipboard,
upload,
download,
email,
home,
user,
print,
phone,
trash,
cancel,
edit,
new,
back,
next,
refresh,
filter,
settings,
chart,
notification,
bookmark,
alarm,

-	IconColorActive â€“ this is the colour of the icon if you turn off the lineal gradient property,
-	IconColour â€“ this is the colour of the icon when you havenâ€™t pressed it,
-	LinealGradient â€“ this is a Boolean property. If you toggle this to true, your icons will have lineal gradient applied to them. If you toggle it to false, they will only have a single tone.
-	LinealGradientColor1 â€“ this is the first lineal gradient colour. This property accepts the following formats â€“ HEX values, rgb values and color names (blue, green etc).
-	LinealGradientColor2 â€“ this is the second lineal gradient colour. This property accepts the following formats â€“ HEX values, rgb values and color names (blue, green etc).
-	BorderRadius â€“ allows you to specify the border radius of your button
-	OnSelect â€“ this is where you will put the OnSelect code
